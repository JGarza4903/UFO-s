# UFO-s

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to help build a website that contains multiple listing of UFO sightings across the country. On this site, viewers will be able to use filters to narrow down results based on Year, City, State, Country or Shape. 

## Results

When website is complete, viewers will be able to read a brief description of the page as well as see a full list of sightings reported. If the viewer would like to narrow down their results they could simply enter their inquiries within the filter search bars located on the left side of the table.

## Summary
Although the viewer is able to filter through her data, the webpage still looks messy when displaying the full dataset across the length of several pages. A possible option would be to put the table in a scrolling field to tidy up the page.

What would really bring the webpage together are visuals of how many sightings have been seen in each state in comparison, either in a bar chart or histogram.
